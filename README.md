# This is the technical test for Wolfpack Digital

Task:
> Implement a simple PHP app that has a data entry system (form etc.) where you can insert info about a car (such as make, model, year, price, km etc.). You should also be able to see the list of cars you inserted. There should also be a JSON API with a simple documentation and some filters (for example: minimum year = 2012, fuel = ‘diesel’, make = ‘Fiat’). Estimated time 2-4 hrs.

What was implemented:
- Show all cars
- Add new car
- Filter by `Dealer`, `Make` and `Model`
